CS 3460:457/557 Computer Graphics
Term Project

Design Report Due: Thursday, March 31, 2022

Project Due: Tuesday, April 19, 2022
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Objective:

The objective of this project is to design and implement an application utilizing the
knowledge of interactive computer graphics.

It can be an individual project or a group project of up-to three people. The amount of
work for a group project should be that of an individual project multiplied by the number
of people in the group.

Possible projects: an online interactive WebGL game (e.g. https://flappybird.io/), an
online studio for designing graphics and/or animation, an interactive learning studio for
computer graphics, an interactive learning studio for game development, a 3D computer
application with NUI (Kinect, LeapMotion, ...), a 3D online application for multi-user
graphical collaboration, a smart phone app with 3D control, graphical interactions (I/O)
with IoT (e.g. Raspberry Pi), ...

Design Report, Demo, Submission:

• Write a 1-page progress report of your project. It should contain a description of
the project, the design of the system, implementation tools to be used, and any
special features that your system is going to have. State clearly how it is much
better than your assignments. In addition, list the percentage of work to be done
by each group member if you are doing a group project. Submit the report by
Thursday, March 31, 2022. (5% of total score).
Submit your report in BrightSpace.

• Based on your design paper, write a 3-page final report on your project to include
implementation details (one page), screen shots, contributions of each group
member, lessons learned and possible future work. Submit your project along
with the final report and the presentation PPT by Tuesday, April 19, 2022.

• Make a five-minute presentation and demo of your project starting Tuesday, April
19, 2022. Your PPT only needs about five pages: title of your project with the
names of the group members, description of the project, design of the system,
implementation tools and issues (if any), and conclusions.
